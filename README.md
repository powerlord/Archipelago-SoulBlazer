# Archipelago-SoulBlazer
SoulBlazer archipelago world

This project may never be competed as I currently don't have the romhacking skills to implement the actual rom patching or even find the correct memory locations for items.  As such, someone else may use this as a base for such an implementation.

This project is initially going to be all the world data one might need to create an Archipelago world minus the rom patching.  This will be based on both playthroughs of the game as well as [data from Data Crystal](https://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/Soul_Blazer)

Note: This is NOT based on LeHulk1 or Orphis's existing randomizers because they have has no listed license and thus can not be used as a base.
